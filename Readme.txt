This is the first attempt at a X2 plugin to interface with  Diffraction Limited
MaxDome II controller. Most of the code comes from the INDI driver written by
Ferran Casarramona ( https://sourceforge.net/p/indi/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/3rdparty/indi-maxdomeii/ ).
The shutter code hasn't been tested.

Pre-compiled versions for OS X, Windows, Unbuntu X86_64 and Rapsberry Pi Pixel can be found there :
