This is the first attempt at a X2 plugin to interface with  Diffraction Limited
MaxDome II controller. Most of the code comes from the INDI driver written by
Ferran Casarramona ( https://sourceforge.net/p/indi/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/3rdparty/indi-maxdomeii/ ).
As far as I can tell some commands might be missing as there is no upper/lower shutter distinction in
the INDI code but the ASCOM driver seems to have a "Open Upper Only" options.
This is beta code.. for testing. and I have no access to the actual hardware.
